Welcome to the Scrababble App, your digital gateway to the classic word game Scrabble. This application offers an engaging way to test your wordplay and strategic prowess. Please read the instructions below to make the most of your Scrababble experience:

## Getting Started

1. **Drag and Drop Letters**: It's as simple as a drag and drop. To construct words, simply drag letters from your rack to the game board. When you release the mouse button, the letter will snugly lock in place.

2. **Undo Your Moves**: Made an unintended error or rethinking your strategy? No problem! Click the "Rewind" button to undo your previous moves and start over.

3. **Unlock Letters**: Placed a letter on the board and want to change your mind? You can unlock it by double-clicking on it.

4. **Skip Your Turn**: Not feeling inspired during your turn? You can pass by clicking the "Fast Forward" button.

5. **Submit Your Play**: Once you've arranged your letters into a word or decided to exchange some of them, confirm your move by pressing the "Play" button.

6. **Exchange Letters**: If you wish to swap out some of your letters, drag the unwanted ones to the bag and release the mouse. Be sure to press the "Play" button to complete the exchange. Note that you can only exchange letters before submitting your play.

7. **Challenge the AI Opponent**: After you've submitted your play, the AI opponent will craft its own wordplay to keep you on your toes.
